# Decision Spinner

üéØ **Built a Clean Decision Spinner for My Partner (No Ads, Just Decisions!)**

My partner was frustrated with online decision wheels cluttered with ads and distractions, so I built a clean, focused alternative - the Decision Spinner!

‚ú® **What makes it special:**
‚Ä¢ Clean, distraction-free interface
‚Ä¢ Persistent storage - your options save automatically
‚Ä¢ Responsive design that works on any device
‚Ä¢ No ads, no tracking, just pure functionality

üõ†Ô∏è **Tech Stack:**
‚Ä¢ **React + TypeScript** for type-safe, maintainable code
‚Ä¢ **Tailwind CSS** for rapid, responsive styling
‚Ä¢ **Vite** for lightning-fast development and builds
‚Ä¢ **Lucide React** for crisp, consistent icons

üöÄ **Deployment Magic:**
‚Ä¢ **GitHub Actions** for automated CI/CD - every push triggers automatic testing and deployment
‚Ä¢ **Netlify** for instant global CDN deployment with branch previews
‚Ä¢ Zero-config deployment means I can focus on features, not infrastructure

The best part? Going from idea to live app took just a few hours thanks to modern tooling. Sometimes the simplest solutions are the most satisfying! 

When you build something your loved ones actually use daily, that's when you know you've created something worthwhile. üíô
